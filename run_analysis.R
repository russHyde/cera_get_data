# This script should do the following:
# Read in the UCI/HAR dataset
# Merge the training and test data into a single dataset
# Subset the columns of the dataset - keeping the mean and sd for each
# measurement
# Rename the activities in the dataset
# Rename the columns of the dataset
# Create a second tidy dataset based on the subset/renamed dataset
# - this should contain the average of each variable for each activity and
# subject

# tidy-data should have the following:
# - each measured variable in a single column
# - each different observation should be in a different row
# - one table for each kind of data
# - when multiple tables are present, there should be a linking column for use
# in merging

# code-book should contain:
# - info about the variables in the submitted data (units etc)
# - info about the summary choices (eg, use of mean or median)
# - info about the expt study design
# - Section called 'Study design' containing thorough description of data
# collection
# - Section called 'Code book' that describes each var and its units
