# This script should do the following:
# Read in the UCI/HAR dataset
# Merge the training and test data into a single dataset
# Subset the columns of the dataset - keeping the mean and sd for each
# measurement
# Rename the activities in the dataset
# Rename the columns of the dataset
# Create a second tidy dataset based on the subset/renamed dataset
# - this should contain the average of each variable for each activity and
# subject
